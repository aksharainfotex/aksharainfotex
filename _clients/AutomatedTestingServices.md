The Reality is that Automation is more utilized during large projects rather than during small ones. Tests can be automated if the system is stable and the requirements to tested areas are not often changed.

**PROPER TEST AUTOMATED TESTING SERVICES CONSIST OF:**
* Elaboration of the requirements.
* Creating the test strategy and plan.
* Writing the code.
* Verifying the scripts.

One shouldn’t also forget about maintenance of the tests. Automated tests should be easily maintained. If their maintenance is time and labour consuming, the tests may turn to be lossmaking.

Automated tests are software products. So, one must refer to the process of automating tests as to any other software development process.

It is recommended to automate only the tests that will run many times in course of the project; if tests are to be performed only once, it is unprofitable to automate them.

## WHY AKSHARAINFOTEX?

* **SOLID EXPERIENCE IN QA OUTSOURCING** : Aksharainfotex’s software testing company successfully performs automated testing services for almost 5 years; average experience of our automated test engineers is 3 – 5 years.
* **QUICK RESULTS**: Our senior, middle and junior test engineers are trained to quickly discover serious functional defects, they know common weaknesses and potential  problem areas in functionality of different software products.
* **AUTOMATION OF REPEATABLE TESTS**: Specialists of our software testing company usually perform functional testing services manually, but our specialists in automation are always ready to automate repeatable tests, for regression testing, for example.

## DECEPTIONS ABOUT AUTOMATED TESTING:

* **AUTOMATED TESTING CAN SUBSTITUTE MANUAL TESTING**: Unfortunately, many people do not understand the real aim of any test automation. It is to facilitate and make more effective manual work of test engineers, give them an opportunity to focus more on problem areas.
* **ANY TESTS CAN BE AUTOMATED**: Tests as any other manual process can be automated. But automation is meaningless if the tests are executed only once. The process of their automation may require more time and efforts than their manual execution.
* **AUTOMATED TESTING SERVICE INCREASES EXPENSES**: Automation requires considerable investment, because it is another software development process. But if it is properly planned and performed, the expenses will return in the ultimate result due to saving time and efforts.
