**WHY IS FUNCTIONAL TESTING NECESSARY?**

Functional Testing services are aimed to verify whether the software product complies with the functional requirements. indicated in its specification.

## Application Functionality must be verified in scope of:

* **MODULE TESTING**: At this stage we check in the context of our software testing services whether functions of the separate modules operate properly.
* **INTEGRATION TESTING**: At this stage we verify if the functions involving interaction of the system modules work as intended.
* **SYSTEM TESTING**: At this stage our quality assurance team carefully examines functionality of the whole system.

## Why AKSHARAINFOTEX?

* **INFORMATIVE AND DETAILED ERROR REPORTS**: Our quality assurance team provides informative and detailed error reports, assists in determining roots of the reported defects.
* **QUICK RESULTS**: Our senior, middle and junior test engineers are trained to quickly discover serious functional defects, they know common weaknesses and potential  problem areas in functionality of different software products.
* **AUTOMATION OF REPEATABLE TESTS**: Specialists of our software testing company usually perform functional testing services manually, but our specialists in automation are always ready to automate repeatable tests, for regression testing, for example.

## Functional Testing Services

Functional software testing covers a broad range of solution functionality, including:

* **Functionality testing—** — Application functional testing is the foundation from which software quality follows. Without core functionality, your software will never meet user needs. We transform requirements into test cases by utilizing best practice test case design. This includes databases, install/config, upgrade and networking features, and ensures a solid foundation for quality assurance and your software deployment.

* **User interface (UI) testing** — This type of testing is critical because features are useless if users can’t figure them out. Can users of varying skill levels easily access and use the application? UI testing for web applications is especially critical where poor usability or slow performance can lead to user dissatisfaction, even when there are no defects.

* **API Testing** – These days, with software development lifecycles being so short and the usage of third-party modules and interfaces on the rise, it’s important to get ahead of the curve. Testing APIs assures that all the data being accessed is properly processed by the API, ensuring better security and compliance testing. Lastly, because API testing occurs prior to any black-box UI related testing, every API defect found may save up to 10 GUI defects later in the project! Test APIs expected outputs with each build and release. If the APIs don’t work, not much will.

* **Data verification testing** — Is data handled consistently throughout your application? For data verification testing, our testing model is divided into three major components resembling the Extract, Transform, and Load paradigm. Our testing ensures that data, calculations and formulas are consistent throughout the application.

* **Regression testing** — Software development and features planned and released are in a constant state of flux. This type of application functional testing uses a strategy customized to your software’s feature set, release schedule, and risk profile to ensure that new changes don’t impact existing functions while ensuring maximum coverage Platform and user compatibility. And with more business users and consumers now opting for mobile devices, it’s not enough to simply re-skin desktop software as “mobile-friendly” — your applications need to work equally well on iOS, Androids, and other mobile operating systems. Knowing how and when to use a multiparameter matrix approach to identify potential areas of concern can be extremely useful.

* **User acceptance testing** — User Acceptance testing is the final Q&A step emulating real-world usage conditions before a software application is released to end-users. These tests are not usually focused on identifying simple problems such as spelling errors and cosmetic problems, nor showstopper defects such as software crashes which should have been fixed during earlier unit level testing phases. Acceptance tests are black-box system-level tests whereby each test represents some expected result from the system given a predefined set of test scenarios of an end-user carrying out their daily usage or process with documented expected results combined with pass/fail criteria. Are expected functions and shortcuts available to users? Do they feel that the application meets their expectations? Acceptance testing ensures you’ve hit the mark from a quality assurance perspective.
